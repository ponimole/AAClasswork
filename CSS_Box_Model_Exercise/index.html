        Peter, Peter pumpkin eater,
        had a wife and couldn't keep her,
        put her in a pumpkin shell,
        and there he kept her very well.

        When I had you to myself,
        I didn't want you around.
        That pretty face just always made you
        stand out from the crowd.

        Then someone pick you up and
        all that face was all it took.
        Now it just too much for me to
        take a second look.
        Oh darling, give me one more chance!
        To show you that I love you.
        Won't you please let me!
        Back in your heart.
